# Graph Search Algorithms

This repository implements various search algorithms on a given graph, starting from node `S` and ending at node `G`. Each algorithm finds the best path from `S` to `G` based on different strategies. The graph and heuristic values are hard-coded, but you can modify them as needed.

## Graph Structure

The graph used in all algorithms:

```
graph = {
    'S': {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 5},
    'A': {'D': 3, 'S': 1, 'B': 1},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'S': 2},
    'C': {'E': 4, 'S': 5},
    'D': {'A': 3, 'G': 2},
    'E': {'C': 4},
    'G': {'D': 2}
}
```

The heuristic values for each node:

```
heuristic = {
    'S': 6,
    'A': 4,
    'B': 3,
    'C': 5,
    'D': 1,
    'E': 3,
    'G': 0
}
```

Hereâ€™s the updated **README** file that includes both **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** explanations:

# Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning 

## Description
The **Minimax Algorithm** is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory, artificial intelligence, and decision-making problems. It operates in a game tree where two players, typically called the Maximizer and the Minimizer, alternate turns. The Maximizer attempts to maximize the score, while the Minimizer tries to minimize it.

**Alpha-Beta Pruning** is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by pruning branches that cannot affect the final decision, thereby making the process faster without losing accuracy.

## How it Works
### Minimax Algorithm:
1. **Maximizing Player**: Tries to maximize the value at the node.
2. **Minimizing Player**: Tries to minimize the value at the node.
3. The algorithm propagates the node values up the tree, ultimately leading to the root node where the decision is made.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning:
- Alpha-beta pruning is an enhancement of the Minimax algorithm that skips branches in the tree that do not affect the final decision. 
- **Alpha**: The best value that the Maximizer can guarantee at the current level.
- **Beta**: The best value that the Minimizer can guarantee at the current level.
- If at any node, `alpha >= beta`, further exploration of that branch is stopped, thus improving the efficiency of the algorithm.

## Example Tree Structure

Both algorithms use the following tree:

```
          N1
        /    \
      N2      N3
     /  \    /  \
   N4   N5  N6   N7
  / \   / \  / \  / \
 1   4 7   2 3   0 6   5
```

- The root node `N1` is a **Maximizer**.
- Nodes `N2` and `N3` are **Minimizers**.
- Nodes `N4`, `N5`, `N6`, and `N7` are **Maximizers**.

The algorithm evaluates the game tree from the leaf nodes (terminal nodes) to the root by alternating between the two players.


## Output for Both Algorithms:

### Minimax Algorithm:
```
Optimal value using Minimax: 5
```

### Alpha-Beta Pruning:
```
Optimal value using Alpha-Beta Pruning: 5
```

### Explanation:
- Both algorithms yield the same optimal value (`5`), but **Alpha-Beta Pruning** performs the evaluation more efficiently by pruning branches of the tree that do not influence the final decision.
